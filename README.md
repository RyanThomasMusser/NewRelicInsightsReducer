## Parameters
* **accountId** - **INT** - Your New Relic account id. This is a necessary parameter. If you need help finding your account id see [New Relic's documentation here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/account-id).  

* **retroactive** - **BOOL** - This determines whether the module will process data retroactively. More information coming.  

* **cadence** - **INT** - The number of hours you want your reduction events to cover. For example: supplying **6** would process 6 hours of data into reduced events. This means that each new reduced event would contains 6 hours worth of data in each newly created event. This is a necessary parameter.  

* **queryKey** - **STRING** - This is an API key that is generated within the New Relic UI that allows you to query your data. This is a necessary parameter. If you need help generating your query key see [New Relic's documentation here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-api/get-data/query-insights-event-data-api#register) . 

* **insertKey** - **STRING** - This is an API key that is generated within the New Relic UI that allows you to insert your data. This is a necessary parameter. If you need help generating your insert key see [New Relic's documentation here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-api/get-data/query-insights-event-data-api#register) . 

* **applicationIds** - **ARRAY** - This is not a necessary parameter. Should you want to filter your data reduction to certain applications, you can supply the specific application ids in this array. If you need help finding your application ids see [New Relic's documentation here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/api-explorer-v2/retrieve-metric-timeslice-data-your-app-explorer#app_id) . 
* **events** - **ARRAY** - This is a necessary parameter. This parameter will decide which events you are reducing, what they will be named and which attributes you will be faceting, and sub-faceting, them off of. **Your reduced events, by default, will return the following attributes**: Â 
  
    * **oldEventName** - **STRING** - The name of the event that you want to target. For example, typical use cases here would be **Transaction**, **PageView**, **TransactionError** or any other out of the box or custom event that is being captured by New Relic Insights.
  * **newEventName** - **STRING** - This is the name that will be given to the newly created, reduced event. Some examples may be **CustomTransactionEvent** or **ReducedTransactionEvent**. This really depends on your preference as it will be the name you use to query the new events within New Relic's Insights.

  * **durations** - **ARRAY** -
