# NewRelicInsightsReducer
This is a module that will help you reduce large amounts of data contained within in New Relic's Insights database.

## Intro
I've designed this tool to help folks reduce large sets of data into more managable chunks. The idea is to give folks greater speed and flexibility in querying data over time. Should you have any questions or concerns, please [file an issue here on GitHub](https://github.com/RyanThomasMusser/NewRelicInsightsReducer/issues/new). Contributions always welcome.

## Installation
```javascript
npm install newRelicInsightsReducer
```

## Example

```javascript
//ensure the library is available
var newRelicInsightsReducer = require('newRelicInsightsReducer');

// Then, define your configuration
var config = {
   accountId : 123456,
   cadence : 6,
   retroactive: false,
   queryKey : "MY_QUERY_KEY",
   insertKey : "MY_INSERT_KEY",
   applicationIds : [1,2,3,4],
   events : [
    {
        oldEventName : "Transaction",
        newEventName : "reducedTransaction",
        facets : [
          {
            facet : "name",
            subFacets : [
              {
                facetValue : "Controller/Car_details/show",
                subFacetProperty : "car_status"
              }
            ],
          },
          {
            facet : "userAgent",
            customFilter : function(facet){
                var fakeFilterValues = ["Tablet","Desktop","Bot","Mobile"];
                return fakeFilterValues[ Math.floor(Math.random() * fakeFilterValues.length) ];
            },
          }
        ],
        durations : [
          {
            name : "duration",
            values : [
              "min","max",50,90,95
            ]
          }
        ],
    }
   ]
};

//Lastly, invoke the function
newRelicInsightsReducer(config);

```

## Parameters
* **accountId** - **INT** - Your New Relic account id. This is a required parameter. If you need help finding your account id see [New Relic's documentation here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/account-id).

* **cadence** - **INT** - The number of hours you want your reduction events to cover. For example: supplying **6** would process 6 hours of data into reduced events. This means that each new reduced event would contains 6 hours worth of data in each newly created event. This is a required parameter. The minimum is 1 hour and maximum is 24 hours. 

* **retroactive** - **INT** - This is not a required parameter. UNIX timestamp. If managed correctly, you can reduce events, at the cadence you specify, since the UNIX timestamp supplied. It will check to find the latest similarly created event type after the supplied UNIX timestamp, and reduce events in the cadence you specify just after that. For example, if I pass 1504600000 (09/05/2017 @ 8:26am (UTC)) in here, it will check for the latest created custom event with the same name after 09/05/2017 @ 8:26am (UTC) and begin reducing events from there. If no other similarly named custom events exist that were created after 09/05/2017 @ 8:26am (UTC), the process will create them beginning on 09/05/2017 @ 8:26am (UTC). It will only create 1 record of custom events. Should you want to populate Insights from a retroactive date, you must call `newRelicInsightsReducer` consecutively.

* **queryKey** - **STRING** - This is an API key that is generated within the New Relic UI that allows you to query your data. This is a required parameter. If you need help generating your query key see [New Relic's documentation here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-api/get-data/query-insights-event-data-api#register) . 

* **insertKey** - **STRING** - This is an API key that is generated within the New Relic UI that allows you to insert your data. This is a required parameter. If you need help generating your insert key see [New Relic's documentation here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-api/get-data/query-insights-event-data-api#register) . 

* **applicationIds** - **ARRAY** - This is not a required parameter. Should you want to filter your data reduction to certain applications, you can supply the specific application ids in this array. If you need help finding your application ids see [New Relic's documentation here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/api-explorer-v2/retrieve-metric-timeslice-data-your-app-explorer#app_id) . 

* **events** - **ARRAY** - This is a required parameter. This parameter will decide which events you are reducing, what they will be named and which attributes you will be faceting, and sub-faceting, them off of. Let's review the event API below: Â 
    
    * **EVENT.oldEventName** - **STRING** - The name of the event that you want to target. For example, typical use cases here would be **Transaction**, **PageView**, **TransactionError** or any other out of the box or custom event that is being captured by New Relic Insights.
    * **EVENT.newEventName** - **STRING** - This is the name that will be given to the newly created, reduced event. Some examples may be **CustomTransactionEvent** or **ReducedTransactionEvent**. This really depends on your preference as it will be the name you use to query the new events within New Relic's Insights.
    * **EVENT.facets** - **ARRAY** - This is a required parameter. This parameter will decide how to facet, sub-facet and run custom filters the events you are reducing. Let's review some examples of the EVENT.facets API below:
        ```javascript
        var facetsArray = 
        [
          {
            //
            //The "facet" property is required. 
            //It's the name of the event property that you want to facet.
            facet : "name",
            //
            //Want to sub-facet? You can! 
            //Below, if the event.facet.name == "Controller/Car_details/show"
            //then those events will be sub-faceted based on their "car_status" property.
            subFacets : 
            [
              {
              facetValue : "Controller/Car_details/show"
              subFacetProperty : "car_status"
              }
            ],
            //
            //You can't use a "subFacet" and a "customFilter" in the same facet object.
            //Look at the facet object below for a "customFilter" usage example.
            customFilter : undefined 
          },
          {
            //
            //The "facet" property is required. 
            //It's the name of the event property that you want to facet.
            facet : "userAgent",
            //
            //You can't use a "subFacet" and a "customFilter" in the same facet object.
            //Look at the facet object above for a "subFacet" usage example.
            subFacet : undefined,
            //
            //The custom filter is a synchronus function. Avoid network calls here.
            //The function passed in here should accept a STRING and return a STRING.
            //In this example, I am imitating filtering the "userAgent" and I would
            //want this function to map "userAgent" to a reduced value of "Mobile",
            //"Tablet", "Desktop" or "Bot". So, instead of returning a reduced event
            //for each unique "userAgent" they would be mapped only to these 4 values.
            customFilter : function(facet){
                //do nothing with the facet value because this is a fake function
                var fakeFilterValues = ["Tablet","Desktop","Bot","Mobile"];
                //and return a random value because this is a fake function
                return fakeFilterValue[ Math.floor(Math.random() * fakeFilterValues.length) ];
                //the return value will replace the original value of "userAgent"
                //which is passed in as the facet parameter
            },
            //
          }
        ]
        ```
    * **EVENT.durations** - **ARRAY** - This is not a required parameter. This parameter will decide how you new custom event will record durations. Let's review some examples of the EVENT.durations API below:
        ```javascript
        var durationsArray = 
        [
          {
            //
            //The "name" property is required. 
            //It's the name of the event's duration property that you want to retrieve.
            name : "duration",
            //
            //Want to percentiles of duration? You got it! 
            //This is a required parameter. Atleast one value must be supplied.
            //The options are as follows:
            values : 
            [
              "min","max",5,10,50,90,95
            ],
          }
        ]
        ```
